# Linear_NN_from_Scratch
## Linear neural network model in object oriented way for classification tasks.

### Model works only for problems with 3 classes.
To expand to more classes implement one hot encoding function in NeuralNetwork.py ->  def one_hot() <br>
Example analysis is run on the palmerpenguin dataset -> https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/ <br>

Network methods can be found in Engine/Interfaces/INeuralNetwork <br>
Example network set up can be found in testNN.py <br>
Example of analysis can be fond in run.py
